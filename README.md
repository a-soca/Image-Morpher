# Image Morpher

## Aims
This Python script uses OpenCV to perform Delaunay triangulation on the profile of an MRI image to transform it to fit any person's silhouette. The code has been designed to be easily modifiable for different generic image morphing applications by simply changing the landmarks array at the top of the script.
